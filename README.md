ScrollSide
=========

ScrollSide aims to prevent the problem presented by mousewheel scrolling on horizontal pages by hijacking the mousewheel event. When youâ€™ve included ScrollSide into your site, your user can use the mouse wheel to scroll up to go left and down to move right.

How to Use
----------

ScrollSide should be initialized when you'd like the mousewheel event to be highjacked -- most likely as soon as possible.
	
### Javascript
	var ss = new ScrollSide(document.body);
